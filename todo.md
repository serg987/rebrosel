# Todos:

- get rid of 'WebDriverHelper.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.' while compiling
- do something with Opera driver trowing no exceptions if browser is closed
- kill the previous webdriver executable if browser is closed (platform - depending)
- get rid of 'Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 7.0.'
